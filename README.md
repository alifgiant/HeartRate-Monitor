HeartRate-Monitor
=================
[This Project are not DONE yet. It still work on progress.]

My Undergraduate Thesis Project  
Reading heart signal- Transmit to Server - Analyze on Server - Forward analized data to Web and Android Phone.

Reading Heart Signal
--------------------
Heart signal readed using [photoplethysmogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram) (PPG) sensor placed on wrist front. PPG used in the project is a product by Joel and Yury ([Pulse Sensor](http://pulsesensor.com/))  
![Pulse Sensor](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0100/6632/products/PulseSensorAmpedFinger-web_2.jpg?v=1348514131)

Transmit to Server 
----------------------
The sensor is controlled by an ESP8266-12E, an S.o.C which already has WiFi module embedded on it. The [sketch](https://github.com/alifgiant/HeartRate-Monitor/tree/NewTA/Sensor) writed using [Platform.io ATOM IDE](http://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/ide/atom.html).

Analyzed on Server
------------------
### Purpose
The heart rate analyzed to obtain:  
* Heart Rate
* Arrhytmhia Classification

### Method
The analizing process followed these steps:

1. Receive heart signal sampled at 3ms (~300 Hz)
2. Start filtering and feature extraction algorithm  
Filtering and Feature extraction algorithm described on [Pan and Tompkins](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gari/teaching/cdt/A3/readings/ECG/Pan+Tompkins.pdf) algorithm. Which band pass (combined of high pass and low pass) filter and Sliding Window thresholding.
3. Start Classification algorithm  
The project use Naive Bayes classifier, trained with [UCI-Lab dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia), using features:
	* QRS duration
	* RR Interval
	* Age
	* Sex
4. Forward Heart Rate and Arrhythmia Classification to subscriber

### Architecture
Server run on [Node.JS(v6.9.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) using [Mongodb(v.3.2.10)](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database. The project depedency can be found on project [folder](https://github.com/alifgiant/HeartRate-Monitor/tree/NewTA/Web).

Forwarded analyzed data
-----------------------
The result will be forwarded to [web](https://github.com/alifgiant/HeartRate-Monitor/tree/NewTA/Web) and [android phone](https://github.com/alifgiant/HeartRate-Monitor/tree/NewTA/Android/Jantung) using WebSocket and MQTT respectively.
